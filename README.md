# Curious Penguins

The First NFT Project Focused on Sustainability.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals
Insert penguin image.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Any questions related to the project can be discussed in the discord community.

## Roadmap
The roadmap is available here: https://curiouspenguin.xyz/#roadmap

## Contributing
Curious Penguins is open to contributions as we build NFT infrastruture. 

For people who want to make changes to your project, please reach out for more on how to get started. 
You will need a GitLab.com account to make any code changes and document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. 

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
We aim to utlize a open source first approach with a focus on Linux. 

## Project status
Active development.
